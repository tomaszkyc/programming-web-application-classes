# Programming Web Applications Classes

This is a repository from our "Programming Web Applications" classes at my university.

## Usage

The repository structure is as follows: 
```
lab \
    lab-x \
        tresci-zadan \
        zadania \
```

where:  
1.  **x** in **lab-x** is number of our classes
2. tresci-zadan - directory with tasks description (PL only)
3. zadania - source code of tasks (mostly in PL - it was a requirement from our teacher)



## Contributing
If you will find that something is not working - it can because of outdated technology we've been using on our classes. I cannot underwrite that this source code still works.
